# Go Font Yourself - Style Transfer for Typeface Generation

![Go Font Yourself Logo](gofontyourself_logo.png)

## Introduction

Welcome to **Go Font Yourself**, a creative experiment in using style transfer techniques to generate fonts. This notebook was instrumental in the development of [www.gofontyourself.xyz](https://www.gofontyourself.xyz) and was presented during the Human Factors in Computing (CHI'21) conference.

## Authors

Paper and code written by Josh Urban Davis and Johann Wentzel

## Key Features

- **Style Transfer for Fonts:** Explore how style transfer can be applied to the generation of unique and artistic fonts.
- **CHI'21 Presentation:** This notebook was showcased at the CHI'21 conference, highlighting its significance in the field of human-computer interaction.
- **User Interface and GAN:** The project includes a web interface and a generative adversarial network (GAN) designed to create fonts inspired by human faces.

## Abstract

User interface design often focuses heavily on clean and minimal aesthetics, often rejecting any deviation as "ugly." This project challenges this abstraction by injecting the human presence back into user interfaces. With typeFACE, a web interface and GAN, we create fonts inspired by human faces. We provide an implementation, discuss historical context, and explore implications in data ownership, identity, and HCI design research.
